I was wanting to move out of the place that I was in and as such needed to find a new place to live. Rather than spending a bunch of time looking through posts I thought "Why can't I have my computer find them and send them to me." The advantage to this is that I would likely get them more promptly, since it isn't waiting until I have a chance to check them. As an added bonus it would be a fun challenge.
