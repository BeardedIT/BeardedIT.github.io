  <h1 class="post-title">The Pandemic Fear</h1>
  <span class="post-date">22 Dec 2021</span>
  <p>As 2020 draws to a close it brings to mind the events of the past two years and the lessons to be learned from it. In this post I want to examine this.</p>

<h3 id="isolation-and-social-distancing">Isolation and Social Distancing</h3>

<p>When it began, we were told “it is only for two weeks”, “help flatten the curve” etc. Soon we were being told it wasn’t enough; that people were dying and we needed to do more. For the first time in a long time, the western world with all its medicine was unsure about how to proceed with the threat of this novel and unknown coronavirus.</p>

<p>The technocrats of the medical field said “If we just stay far enough from the sick, we can slow or stop the spread.” Isolation for the sick and social distancing began to become the law of the day. Non-essential services were shut down or forced to alter their method of service. Food delivery businesses were booming and people were afraid to go out of their houses. Mental health plummeted and with it rose suicide and anxiety disorders <sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup> ‘Essential’ services; those in healthcare, law enforcement, emergency services, trades, and supply chain continued however to do their jobs in an effort to maintain society.</p>

<p>In case they were asymptomatic but contagious, travelers began to be mandated to isolate upon arrival. The fear that this invisible virus would cross borders undetected prompted mandatory isolations of 14 days. All efforts proved fruitless. The virus continued to spread across borders. Gone were the promises of ‘two weeks.’</p>

<h3 id="vaccines">Vaccines</h3>

<p>“We’re working on a vaccine” became the cry. The world waited with bated breath for its arrival. “Soon life can return to normal.” People hoped they could finally get out of their houses and started seeing each other. Soon they would be able to gather for holidays and parties again. Soon work could return to the office.</p>

<p>The injections began with the seniors and vulnerable people and moved on to the younger and those in better health. As rollout began, the efficacy of the vaccines proved to be less than originally hoped due to the changing nature of the virus. The virus had mutated. The Delta variant started wreaking havoc in the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike. Side effects from vaccines began to be seen such as myocarditis and pericarditis.<sup><a href="#references">2</a></sup> Some had allergic reactions as well.</p>

<h3 id="fear-and-division">Fear and Division</h3>

<p>As vaccinations continued, it became apparent that not everyone was interested in getting vaccinated with many provinces struggling to pass the 70% threshold. While not outright saying that it was a requirement, governments began ‘making it very uncomfortable to remain unvaccinated’<sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup>. Many non-essential services were told they must ask for proof of vaccination or have their capacity limited. With this, the un-elected officials fed the narrative that if you are unvaccinated then you are a menace to society and deserve to be denied entry. People began to think twice about who they would associate with.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>I do not believe that government has the right to tell people that they must be vaccinated to remain a part of society as a whole. It should be up to each individual as to whether they are going to be vaccinated or not especially since the efficacy of the said vaccine is debatable. Those who are vaccinated are no better or worse than those who are not.</p>

<p>Now I’ll admit I have lived fairly sheltered from Covid as a result of where I live and I have not seen the effects that it has had on the healthcare system aside from what the media has portrayed or experienced a death connected to it. Perhaps if I had I would not come to the same conclusions.</p>

<p>At the same time because I have not had the misfortune of experiencing the worst of this pandemic I have perhaps been able to see the more hidden and more insidious pandemic. Hiding in our basements and behind our vaccinations does not address the real pandemic. That is the pandemic of fear. All of the decisions that have been made thus far have been due to fear. Fear of the virus spreading. Fear of hospitals being overrun. Fear of missing out on life. Fear of government reprisal. We don’t have a covid problem, we have a fear problem.</p>

<p>Ultimately I would posit that the way the world recovers from the covid-19 pandemic is by fighting back against the fear. Learn what we can and move on from it. It is not going anywhere so we need to learn how to live with it. Yes, people may die. Yes, there will be people who are affected in other ways. But we cannot allow that to stop us from moving on. If we do not I believe we may do more harm than good. From the loss of rights to the polarization of society, we lose more than we gain at this point.</p>
