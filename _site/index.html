    <p>As 2020 draws to a close it brings to mind the events of the past two years and the lessons to be learned from it. In this post I want to examine this.</p>

    <p>My girlfriend and I are going to be planting a garden this year, however we live in town and do not have space for such a thing. We do however have access to a garden space that is out in a rural area about 30 minutes from us. To avoid having to drive this distance just to water I had the thought of making an automated irrigation system. The challenge was to create a system that was low-cost but also remotely controllable.</p>

    <p>I was wanting to move out of the place that I was in and as such needed to find a new place to live. Rather than spending a bunch of time looking through posts I thought “Why can’t I have my computer find them and send them to me.”</p>

    <p>I have been thinking lately about the power of the internet and the ways that people can become and do and say things that they would not usually do or say either from the web. It is an equalizing and possibly anonymous, if that is what the situation warrants, platform for voicing the opinion of the people and making known what is happening around the world.</p>
