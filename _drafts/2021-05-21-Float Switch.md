My girlfriend and I are going to be planting a garden this year, however we live in town and do not have space for such a thing. We do however have access to a garden space that is out in a rural area about 30 minutes from us. To avoid having to drive this distance just to water I had the thought of making an automated irrigation system. The challenge was to create a system that was low-cost but also remotely controllable.

## The Requirements

* Cheap
* Reliable
* Remote-control
* Automation

## The Solution
